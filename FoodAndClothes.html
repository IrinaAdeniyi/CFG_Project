        <h2>Sarmale</h2>
        <p style="color: #232323;">
            Sarmale is the national dish of Romania. This dish is consumed at every big celebration, such as Christmas, Easter, weddings, christenings and even funerals. 
            Sarmale consists of pickled cabbage rolls filled with a mixture of minced meat and herbs. The making of the sarmale dish can be tedious because the rolling of the meat in the cabbage is time consuming and the cooking time is 2 hours or more, to ensure the cabbage has become soft enough. Smaller sarmale are preferred and only the most skilled are able to roll them small. Each family has their own traditional recipe, which varies from the south to the north of the country. In some parts of the country tomato sauce is added to the pot, in some parts smoked pork or pork ribs are added to the pot, in some other parts both are added. No matter how you choose to cook them, they are always delicious.
            Sarmale is served with polenta, sour cream, and pickled green chilli pepper.

        <h2>Tripe soup</h2>
        <p style="color: #232323;">
            Another favourite and famous Romanian dish is the tripe soup. This is quite controversial, as people either love it or hate it. Whether you hate or love it can be determined by the first time you try it. As with sarmale, different people cook it differently, therefore if you are lucky to taste a well done one, you will always like it. 
            Tripe soup is sour, dressed with sour cream and egg yolks. The tripe is washed very well, then boiled for quite a while until soft, and cut into small stripes. It can have a chewy-like texture and a distinctive smell, which can put some people off from having it. But if you do have the courage to try it, you will quickly discover that it is a proper delicacy!
            This soup can be consumed with garlic sauce, pickled green chilli, extra sour cream or vinegar.

        <h2>Cozonac (dessert)</h2>
        <p style="color: #232323;">
            Cozonac is a sweetened yeast bread with a nutty cocoa centre. This dessert is traditionally consumed during Easter and Christmas and is enjoyed by everyone. The cooking can be a little tricky and time consuming, but it is well worth it. Even though traditionally, the cozonac is filled with a cocoa and walnut paste, the filling can vary and every family can choose their favourites, from simple cocoa to nutella to dried fruits and nuts. 
            When the cozonac is ready it fills the house with a sweet delicious smell and it is impossible to resist waiting until it cools down. Having a slice of warm cozonac is the best!

        <h2>Traditional clothes</h2>
        <p style="color: #232323;">
            Traditional clothes are not commonly worn on the streets nowadays. In some small villages people will still wear them on special occasions like weddings and christenings, as a festive wear. Many of the young cherish old traditional clothes left from their grandparents and keep them as memories of their grandparents' lives and of another world.
            In general these clothes are somewhat similar, but different costumes are specific to different regions. The Romanian traditional clothes are insipred from Geto-Dacians.
            The women costume commonly consists of: ie (shirt), poale (the skirt), fota (a colourful cover on top of the skirt), marame or naframe (a piece of colourful material that is worn on the head) and braie or bete (some kind of belt).
            The men attire consists of: ie (shirt), pants, brau (some kind of belt) and chimir (a jacket without arms made from animal skin).
